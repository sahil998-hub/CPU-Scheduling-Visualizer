This is a simple and interactive web project that helps you understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms work. It's built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can try it here:
https://cpu-scheduling-visualizer-six.vercel.app/

It shows how different scheduling algorithms manage processes. You can choose an algorithm from a dropdown menu, enter process details, and see how the algorithm schedules them.

Supported algorithms:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First)

LJF (Longest Job First)

SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)

LRTF (Longest Remaining Time First)

RR (Round Robin)

Priority (Non-Preemptive)

Priority (Preemptive)
